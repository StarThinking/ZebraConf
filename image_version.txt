sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-0.2: 1) ran all unit tests; 2) replace jar
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-0.3: make sure .m2 includes all the jars by running the tests of all sub projects
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-0.4: this version has replaced m2 jars with hacked versions of jar
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-0.5: just remove Tool
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-0.6: keep the node as the eurosys submission
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-0.7: hadoop common hacked by javassist
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-0.8: overwrite junit m2 jar 4.12
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-0.8.1: overwrite junit m2 jar 4.12 not disable it to output message
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-0.9: add back Tool and abandon assert fail skip
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.0: fix the static_id issue for hdfs mover and balancer.
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.1: shrink image size by rebuilding with clean image, but cloning 1.0's maven repository (current stable version)
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.2: print out get-return info anyway, remember to call m2_util script.
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.3: just called m2_util script extrally
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.4: add Flink's ALL_TESTS.txt and mapping.txt
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.4.1: this is clean Flink again to test to get all tests
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.4.2: clean flink_1.12 with listener ready, except config and node hacking.
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.4.3: clean configuration with printing message in importmant nodes.
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.4.4: hacked configuration + non-shareing rpc and taskmanagerrpcfactory in minicluster.
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.4.5: hacked configuration(+ hacked hashcode and equals) + non-shareing rpc and taskmanagerrpcfactory in minicluster.
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.4.6: hacked all
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.4.7: fix the 'ERROR: registered before' bug because of TaskManager in minicluster was not using static id; and hacked TaskManager and ClusterEntryPoint init functions; also we simply let registerMyComponent return unique/root conf when we find the node has been registered before, identified by its hashcode; also, we removed hadoop:Tool because it only helps to detect 'dfs.http.policy' with tool like Dsync (I think this parameter can be reported without hacking hadoop:Tool)

sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.5.1: remove Flink TaskManager's hacking for seperating RPC and remove Minicluster's hacking for RPC unsharing (incorrect version; delete it later)
sixiangma/reconf_parameter:artifact-1.5.7: 1.5 with latest ZebraConf git (the most latest version)
